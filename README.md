# VELA: Eco-Crypto Data Science
# ðŸŒŠ VELA Eco-Crypto Data Science Project

## Overview
This project merges **climate data** (COâ‚‚ and global temperature anomalies) with **crypto market data** (BTC & ETH).  
It demonstrates how environmental urgency and financial innovation can be analyzed together â€” forming the backbone of **VELAâ€™s mission**: aligning **capital formation with ocean conservation**.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Sources**
  - NOAA Mauna Loa COâ‚‚ monthly series  
  - NASA/NOAA global temperature anomalies (NetCDF)  
  - BTC & ETH market data via Yahoo Finance  

- **Analysis**
  - Cleaned and aligned environmental + financial data on a monthly timeline  
  - Feature engineering: rolling volatility, returns, and volume changes  
  - Hypothesis tests:
    - Post-2000 temperatures significantly higher than pre-2000  
    - BTC weekend vs weekday volatility differences  
  - Linear regression (via normal equations) quantified COâ‚‚ â†’ temperature anomaly relationship  
  - Residual and correlation analysis to validate trends

## What We Learned
- **Climate:** Rising COâ‚‚ strongly correlates with higher global temperature anomalies.  
- **Crypto:** BTC & ETH volatility clusters reveal structural patterns useful for tokenomics design.  
- **Cross-Domain:** Climate stress and crypto adoption rise in the same era â€” opening the door for VELA to connect financial flows with ocean impact.

## Why This Matters
- **For VELA:** Provides data-driven storytelling for investors and community members.  
- **For Hiring Managers:** Showcases end-to-end data science workflow â€” data wrangling, hypothesis testing, linear algebra, visualization â€” with real-world context.  
- **For Stakeholders:** Transparent, reproducible analysis ensures credibility and impact.
